This application coordinates access to the fingerprint hardware for authenticating a user locally.

Purpose:

This API coordinates access to the fingerprint hardware for authenticating a user locally. 
Fingerprint hardware which is a biometric fingerprint reader that takes the place on the devices where manufactureâ€™s integrated. Using this API the user can authenticate various payments, unlock the device and so forth. Finger print API is securely stored in the secure enclave of the device and is not accessible outside. 
Hence this authentication mechanism is very secure.
